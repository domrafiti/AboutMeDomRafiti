            <p>Throughout my participation in Boot Camp I want to highlight some of my faorite projects that I've bene
                fortunate enough to work on. One of the projects highlighted below is a group project and the other is
                an individual project</p>

                        <p class="card-text">This was a really fun project to work on and I was paired up with a great
                            team. We set out to create an application that would allow multiple users to create listings
                            (like classified ads) that allow users to trade goods and services for other goods and
                            services. </p>
                        <p class="card-text">We had some really grand ideas for this application and did a greally nice
                            job bringing them to fruitionin the 15-20 hours alotted. Users are able to sign up on the
                            platform, search for other users listings, create and manage their own listings, and even
                            communicate with other platform users through SendGrid.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">My contribution to this project was all over the place. I was the acting
                            project manager, and split my time (to the best of my ability) as an unbiased project
                            manager - focusing on developing the ideas and processes of my developer team - and a team
                            member who had to produce. My largest contribution was around file uploads and handling,
                            ensuring they could be used for our listings. Given more time, we would have implemented
                            data storage through AWS S3. </p>

                            team. We set out to create an application that would allow a user to interact with The New
                            York Metropolitan Museum of Art's collection of art. </p>
                        <p class="card-text">We built a two step search process with some advanced filtering options
                            that allow a user to start by using a simple keyword search and then applying advanced
                            filters based on timeframe, and region. Once the search had been executed we would display a
                            picture of the image in a rustic frame and some facts about the artwork. </p>
                        <p class="card-text">My focus on this project was around testing and configuring the API, as
                            well as managing the data returned from the search and manipulating the DOM. </p>

                        <p class="card-text">This was one of the more challenging projects through the first third of
                            the bootcamp. The goal was to create a very simple interactive quiz about JavaScript. In
                            addition to rotating through questions, the application needed to track the users correct
                            and incorrect answer selections and provide an option for tracking high scores.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">I had invest hours working on this project with my classmates and had even
                            met with a tutor. I was still stuck with a little over 1 day left to create a functioning
                            project and decided to simply start over and see how far I could get. Ater taking a deep
                            breath and really focusing on developing good Psuedocode I was able to get the project to
                            95% complete in what felt like no time.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">The biggest thing I took away from this project was to not give up and that
                            sometimes it is ok to start with a fresh slate. </p>
